                <p>Chester Charles Bennington (March 20, 1976 - July 20, 2017) was an American singer who served as the lead vocalist of rock band Linkin Park. He was also a lead vocalist of Grey Daze, Dead by Sunrise and Stone Temple Pilots at various points./p>

            <div class="accord-panel">
                <p>Bennington first gained prominence as a vocalist following the release of Linkin Park's debut album, Hybrid Theory (2000), which was a worldwide commercial success. The album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005, making it the bestselling debut album of the decade, as well as one of the few albums ever to achieve that many sales. He continued to serve as the band's lead vocalist for their next six studio albums, from Meteora (2003) to One More Light (2017), with each charting within the top three spots of the Billboard 200.

                    Bennington formed his own band, Dead by Sunrise, as a side project in 2005. The band's debut album, Out of Ashes, was released on October 13, 2009. He became the lead singer of Stone Temple Pilots in 2013 to release the extended play record High Rise on October 8, 2013, via their own record label, Play Pen, but left in 2015 to focus solely on Linkin Park. As an actor, he appeared in films such as Crank (2006), Crank: High Voltage (2009), and Saw 3D (2010).</p>

            <div class="accord-panel">
                <p>Bennington struggled with depression and substance abuse for most of his life, starting in his childhood. On July 20, 2017, he was found dead at his home in Palos Verdes Estates, California. The coroner concluded that he had died as a result of suicide by hanging. Hit Parader magazine placed Bennington at number 46 on their list of the "Top 100 Metal Vocalists of All Time". Bennington has been ranked by several publications as one of the greatest rock vocalists of his generation. Writing for Billboard, Dan Weiss stated that Bennington "turned nu-metal universal".</p>

    <h2>PERSONAL LIFE</h2>

            <button class="accord-label">Family and views</button>
            <div class="accord-panel">
                <p>Bennington had a son, Jaime (born May 12, 1996), from his relationship with Elka Brand. In 2006, he adopted Brand's other son, Isaiah (born November 8, 1997). He married his first wife, Samantha Marie Olit, on October 31, 1996. They had one child together, Draven Sebastian (born April 19, 2002). Bennington's relationship with his first wife declined during his early years with Linkin Park, and they divorced in 2005.

                    In 2006, he married Talinda Ann Bentley, a former Playboy model with whom he had three children: Tyler Lee Bennington (born March 16, 2006) and twins Lily and Lila (born November 9, 2011). Chester and Talinda Bennington were harassed by a cyberstalker, who was later found guilty in 2008 of tampering with the couple's email and other personal information, as well as sending threatening messages, and was sentenced to two years in prison.
                    
                    Bennington was a tattoo enthusiast. He had done work and promotions with Club Tattoo, a tattoo parlor in Tempe, Arizona. Club Tattoo is owned by Sean Dowdell, Bennington's friend since high school with whom he played in two bands.
                    
                    Bennington was a fan of the Phoenix Suns, Arizona Cardinals, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Arizona Coyotes.
                    
                    In a January 2011 interview, in response to the 2011 Tucson shooting, Bennington said, "There's a non-violent way to express yourself and get your point across - regardless of what you're saying or what your point is. In a free society, people have a right to believe whatever they want to believe. That's their business and they can speak their mind. But nobody, even in a free society, has the right to take another person's life. Ever. That's something that we really need to move beyond."
                    
                    Bennington was a critic of U.S. president Donald Trump. On January 29, 2017, he tweeted that Trump was "a greater threat to the USA than terrorism". This tweet resurfaced in July 2020 after Linkin Park sent Trump a cease and desist order for using "In the End" in an ad for his re-election campaign that year.</p>

            <div class="accord-panel">
                <p>Bennington was plagued with poor health during the making of Meteora, and struggled to attend some of the album's recording sessions. In the summer of 2003, he began to suffer from extreme abdominal pain and gastrointestinal issues while filming the music video for "Numb" in Prague. He was forced to return to the United States for surgery, and filmed the remainder of the music video in Los Angeles.

                    Bennington sustained a wrist injury in October 2007 while attempting to jump off a platform during a show in Melbourne at the Rod Laver Arena. Despite the injury, he continued to perform the entire show with a broken wrist, before heading to an emergency department, where he received five stitches.
                    
                    In 2011, Bennington fell ill again, and Linkin Park was forced to cancel three shows and reschedule two from the A Thousand Suns World Tour. He injured his shoulder during the band's tour in Asia and was advised by doctors to have immediate surgery, canceling their final show at Pensacola Beach, Florida, and ending their tour.
                    
                    Bennington struggled with depression and substance abuse.[65] He overcame his drug addiction and would go on to denounce drug use in future interviews. He later battled with alcoholism during his tenure with Linkin Park, which he overcame following an intervention from his bandmates. In 2011, he said he had quit drinking, noting: "I just don't want to be that person anymore."
                    
                    Bennington injured his ankle in January 2015 during a basketball game.[69] He attempted to cope with the injury and perform with the aid of crutches and a knee scooter. Linkin Park later canceled the remainder of their tour to allow Bennington to undergo surgery and recover.</p>

            <button class="accord-label">Friendship with Chris Cornell</button>
            <div class="accord-panel">
                <p>Bennington was a close friend of Chris Cornell. They became friends during a tour they shared in the mid-2000s. The chemistry between the two had strengthened during the 2007-2008 Projekt Revolution Tour when Bennington joined Cornell on stage to sing Temple of the Dog's "Hunger Strike", and then Cornell joined Linkin Park to sing "Crawling". He was also the godfather of Cornell's son Christopher.

                    Cornell died by suicide on May 18, 2017. Bennington commented on Cornell's death on Instagram, stating that he could not imagine a world without Cornell in it. Shinoda noted that Bennington was very emotional when the band performed "One More Light" in Cornell's honor on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Bennington could not finish singing the song during rehearsal because he started getting choked up. The band was due to record a live performance of their single "Heavy" on the show, but Bennington decided instead to play "One More Light" after hearing the news about Cornell's death, since the song is about the loss of a friend.
                    
                    On May 26, 2017, a week after his Kimmel performance, Bennington sang Leonard Cohen's song "Hallelujah" at Cornell's funeral in Los Angeles.</p>

        <h2>Lost</h2>
        <img src="images/cb2.png" alt="Official image">
        <p>“Lost” is a song from the Meteora recording sessions that was officially released on February 10th, 2023 as the first pre-release song from the 20th Anniversary Edition of Meteora.

            “Lost” is a song that became popular in the Linkin Park fan community when the DVD of their second album Meteora was released in 2003. On The Making Of Meteora DVD that was released with Meteora, fans immediately noticed a demo that wasn't on the album which had vocals recorded for it. In this case, a five second clip of Chester singing “thoughts that take away my pride, trapped in places deep inside” over an instrumental has almost become legendary in the Linkin Park community and has appeared on fans' Linkin Park Underground CD wishlists for years. A lyric sheet of the song with the demo bridge can also be seen on the DVD. The words were scribbled on the Meteora art wall at one point when Linkin Park, Delta, and Frank Maddocks were making it in the summer of 2002.

        <p>Chester Bennington of Linkin Park sings the dark themed song “System”, which is produced by Jonathan Davis of Korn for the Queen of the Damned soundtrack (released March 1, 2002).

            Jonathan Davis also recorded a version of this song himself, but it was never released.</p>

        <h2>Cross Off </h2>
        <img src="images/cb4.jpg" alt="Album official image">
        <p>“Cross Off” is a single produced by Mark Morton of Lamb of God and features late singer Chester Bennington, formerly the lead singer of Linkin Park. It was recorded not long before Bennington’s suicide in July of 2017.

            This song can be seen as a return to some of the heavier music that Chester Bennington had produced with Linkin Park prior to their 2017 One More Light album.</p>

    <div class="tab-panel" id="tab4">
        <h2>In the End</h2>
        <img src="images/cb5.png" alt="Album official image">
        <p>“In the End” is mainly based on one person's failure.

            Its most possible meaning is that it's about time wasted on trying to build a relationship with a girl who doesn't want to be with you.</p>

    <div class="tab-panel" id="tab5">
        <h2>Numb</h2>
        <img src="images/cb6.png" alt="Album official image">
        <p>“Numb” is the third single and the final track of Linkin Park's second studio album, Meteora.

            One of Linkin Park's most well known and critically acclaimed songs, “Numb” topped the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for 12 weeks. The song spent six weeks at the top of the chart in 2003 and six weeks in 2004, making it the only song in history to be the most successful song of the year on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart for two years. The song also spent three weeks atop the Billboard Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and peaked at #11 on the Billboard Hot 100.
            
            The song was later combined with Jay-Z's song “Encore” to create “Numb/Encore”, a massive hit for both artists which was featured on the album Collision Course and earned them the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. “Numb” was ranked #95 on Rhapsody’s list of the Top 100 Tracks of the Decade.
            
            On November 8, 2018, the music video on YouTube reached 1B views and is the first Linkin Park music video to reach 1B views.</p>
